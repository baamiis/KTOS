 * Sets up the initial "saved" CPU context on the task's stack.
 * When this task is first switched to via ktos_hal_ContextSwitch, it should begin
 * execution at task_func_addr with the provided initial message parameters.
 * When task_func_addr returns, execution should transfer to task_exit_handler_addr,
 * passing the WORD return value of task_func_addr as an argument.
 *
 * @param p_stack_base Pointer to the base of the allocated stack memory.
 *                     Stack typically grows towards lower addresses from (p_stack_base + stack_size_bytes).
 * @param stack_size_bytes Total size of the stack memory in bytes.
 * @param task_func_addr Pointer to the C function the task will execute.
 * @param task_exit_handler_addr Pointer to a C function that will be called if task_func_addr returns.
 *                               This handler is responsible for passing the task's return value
 *                               to the OS and yielding control back.
 * @param initial_msg_type The MsgType for the task's first execution.
 * @param initial_sparam The sParam for the task's first execution.
 * @param initial_lparam The lParam for the task's first execution.
 * @return The initial stack pointer value for this task. This value will be stored in Task->StackPtr.
 *         Returns NULL on failure (e.g., if stack size is too small for initial context).
 * Must be implemented by the BSP (likely involves some assembly).
